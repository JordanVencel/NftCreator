# NftCreator
This is set of simple Java Processing scripts I wrote. 
It is capable of generating any number of NFT images from a set of formatted input png files.  
It also generates metadata to accompany each NFT. 

Take Note: You must have the Processing IDE installed locally in order for these scripts to work.
