# NftCreator

Processing is a flexible coding-based sketchbook and a language.

This repo contains a few iterations of Processing scripts I wrote after I decided 
I wanted to write software that could create a NFT collection with unique, varied, 
and editable elements.  

It is capable of generating any number of NFT images from a set of formatted input png files.  
It also generates user-prompted metadata to accompany each NFT.

Take Note: You must have the Processing IDE installed locally in order for these scripts to work. 

I have a much further iterated and much more robust version of this software sitting on my
machine.

I created this new version to accomodate the unique requirements of my client's NFT collection.
I will push this better version once I develop the software enough to use general user-input. 

My desire is to provide this software for artists or other people to download and use it easily and intuitively.
